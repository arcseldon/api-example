api-example (last tested with 1.0.17)
===========

A working example of the grails-api-toolkit implemented within a project.

Key pieces are:

- grails-app/conf/Bootstrap.groovy : this shows how apidocs are bootstrapped
- grails-app/controllers/TestController.groovy : this shows how controllers are annotated
